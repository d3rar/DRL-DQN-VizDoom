- A custom VizDoom environment with shaped rewards

- A PyTorch DQN implementation (CNN encoder + MLP head)

- A training script that logs reward components per episode

- Evaluation and gameplay visualization (replays, GIFs)

- ONNX export of the trained policy for seamless deployment

- Clone, install dependencies, and run train.py to get started!
